Overview
========
c-retime, or cretime (pronounced Cree-time, not See-retime!) is a simple command line tool for retiming segments of youtube videos.
It should in theory allow you to retime a segment of any youtube video for any purpose, but it's main purpose is to make retiming speedruns easier.
Due to it's use of getopt to parse command line options, this doesn't work on Windows, but I may make a windows option eventually.


Usage
========
If cretime is in your PATH, just run
    cretime [OPTIONS]...
and if it is not in your PATH, you can run
    ./cretime [OPTIONS]...

For example:
    cretime -mf 30

When run, if no FPS is supplied with the -f or --fps flags, you will be prompted for the videos FPS.
After that, you will be prompted to paste the youtube debug info of the video for the beginning frame.
Then do the same for the end frame.
Finally the end time or a mod note will be output depending on if you used the -m or --mod-note flags.

If you want to have the mod note automatically copied to the clipboard, you will need to copy the output manually.
Alternatively, you can use the retime.sh shell script included in the repo which does have a -c/--copy option to copy to the clipboard, but it's not as convienient when inputting the YT debug info.


Flags
=====
Functionality:
    -b, --bulk-retime       (This will loop the program over and over, useful when retiming multiple runs)
    -f, --fps=FPS           (Lets you manually set the fps of the video being retimed)
    -m, --mod-note          (Output a mod note instead of just the run duration)

Miscellaneous:
    -h, --help              (Get help!)
    -v, --version           (Just version info)
