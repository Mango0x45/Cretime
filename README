This is a simple posix compliant youtube video retiming tool.
This was written with the purpose of making retiming speedruns easier.
Should work on MacOS, Linux, and most other unix-like operating systems.
On MacOS, pbcopy is used for copying mod messages, however on other platforms you have the choice of xclip and xsel.
If you have both xclip and xsel, xclip takes preference.
