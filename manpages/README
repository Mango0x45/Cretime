Overview
========
This directory contains the manpages for the cretime and shretime programs. You can view a manpage with the following command:
    man ./path/to/manpage
For example:
    man ./Retime/manpages/cretime.1

Alternatively, if you would like to be able to call the manpages directly with
    man cretime
    man shretime
you can simply copy the manpages to one of the following directories:
    /usr/share/man/man1/
    /usr/local/man/man1/
    /usr/local/share/man/man1/
